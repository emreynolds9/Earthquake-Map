# Mapping Recent Earthquakes with D3 and JavaScript

This visualization utilizes the [United States Geographical Survey API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
 to map global earthquakes in the last seven days. I used JavaScript and Leaflet to create an interactive map that changes in real time.
