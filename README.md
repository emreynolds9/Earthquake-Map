# Mapping Recent Earthquakes with D3 and JavaScript



This vizualization depicts a map of earthquakes that occurred across the world within the last week. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

After assembling the dataset, I used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends or correlations found in the data.
